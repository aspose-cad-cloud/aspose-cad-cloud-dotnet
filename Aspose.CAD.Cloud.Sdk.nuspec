		<summary>New generation of Aspose Cloud SDK that allows to manipulate, edit or convert CAD and BIM drawings (10+ file formats) in Aspose Cloud from .NET applications.</summary>
        <description>Aspose.CAD Cloud enables your applications to perform a great range of drawing processing tasks. With Aspose.CAD you can load, save and convert drawings of the following formats: DWG, DXF, DWF, DWFX, DWT, STL, IGS, DGN, OBJ and CF2. Such drawings might be converted into variety of raster and vector formats: BMP, JPEG, J2K, JP2, GIF, PSD, PDF, WMF, SVG, PNG, TIFF. 
            
With Aspose.CAD you can modify, convert and render drawings and plots without utilizing Autodesk AutoCAD®. Aspose.CAD Cloud is well documented to help you create your solutions on different platforms.
            
Rich Set of Features

Conversions: High quality conversions to variety of raster and vector formats including PNG and PDF.
Document Object Model: Programmatic access through a rich API to all drawing elements and formatting allows to modify, extract and replace drawings content.
Rendering: Convert whole documents or pages to PDF, XPS or for server-side document generation. Also convert document pages to TIFF, PNG, BMP or EMF images, print or render pages to .NET Graphics. All with high fidelity - exactly like Microsoft Word® would have done it.

Performance and Scalability
            
Aspose.CAD Cloud is designed to perform great. You can literally generate thousands of drawing in minutes with Aspose.CAD Cloud and that involves opening a drawing, modifying content and populating it with data and exporting it. Even most of the complex drawings are opened and saved in fractions of a second.
